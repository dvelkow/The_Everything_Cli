A single terminal prompt to operate your entire life.

## What is this?

Most of your day is scattered across a dozen apps — tasks in one place, notes in another, calendars somewhere else, finances in a spreadsheet you forgot about. **EV** brings all of that into the one place you're already staring at: your terminal.

No context switching. No browser tabs. No notifications pulling you away. Just you and a blinking cursor, getting things done.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dvelkow/The_Everything_Cli.git
cd The_Everything_Cli

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Link the CLI globally
npm link

# Launch it
ev
```

That's it. Type `ev` from anywhere and you're in.

## Built-in Commands

| Command   | What it does              |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| `help`    | Show available commands   |
| `about`   | Learn what EV is          |
| `version` | Print current version     |
| `clear`   | Clear the screen          |
| `exit`    | Quit                      |

## What's Coming

This is the foundation. The building blocks are in place — the shell, the prompt, the command router. What gets built on top is where it gets interesting:

- **Tasks & todos** — manage your day without leaving the terminal
- **Quick notes** — capture thoughts instantly
- **Habit tracking** — streaks and accountability, CLI-style
- **Finance snapshots** — know where your money went
- **Calendar glances** — see what's next without opening anything
- **Pomodoro timer** — focus sessions built right in

## Philosophy

If you live in the terminal, your tools should too. EV isn't trying to replace every app on your phone — it's trying to give you a fast, distraction-free way to handle the things that matter, right where you already are.
